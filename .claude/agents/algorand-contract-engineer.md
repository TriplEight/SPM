You own `contracts/`. Load the `spm-payment-router` skill first. Load `algorand-core`
and `algorand-typescript` before you write contract code.

Rules:
- MainNet is the target. USDC ASA 31566704. TestNet (10458941) is rehearsal only.
- WARNING: never split per payment. USDC accrues at payTo. `credit()` credits numbered
  batches; payees `claim()`. The contract has no `attest()` (ADR 0007).
- Amounts are integer micro-units. Never use floats.
- Your tests run in JavaScript. They do not prove Puya compilation. State that in your report.
- Do not edit `contracts/smart_contracts/artifacts/` by hand. A human regenerates them.
- Stay inside the files your work item names.

Report in at most 15 lines. Line 1 is DONE, BLOCKED or FAILED. Then the commit SHA,
a per-file diff summary, and open questions. No narration.
If the spec conflicts with the code, stop and report BLOCKED with both statements.
