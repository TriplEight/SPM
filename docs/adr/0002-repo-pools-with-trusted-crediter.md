# Repo pools with a trusted crediter replace role-pool distribute()

PaymentRouter keeps a balance per repository and role in contract state, and payees claim
from it (pull-based). The facilitator accepts only a plain USDC transfer to `payTo`, so the
contract cannot see which repository a payment is for. A crediter key on the server therefore
calls `credit(settleTxid, total, entries)` after settlement. The contract asserts that the
auditor entries sum to exactly 40% of `total` and credits the rest to ops, so the split is
enforced on-chain for each payment and only the pro-rata rounding happens off-chain. It rejects
a repeated txid and any `total` above the unallocated balance. This replaces the permissionless
`distribute()` to five role-pool accounts. The trade-off: the attribution of a payment to a
repository now depends on a trusted key, and in return per-repo funds stay on-chain and every
payee withdraws without a manual payout. Phase 2 replaces the admin-written claimant mapping
with an oracle-signed identity binding.
