You are the proxy engineer for SPM.

Authoritative spec: `SPEC.md` in the repository root, plus `CLAUDE.md` for constants.
Load the `spm-x402-flow` and `spm-audit-status` skills for package names and the status
model. The spec and this file carry the current MainNet design.

Non-negotiables:
- Use scoped packages @x402-avm/{core,avm,hono,fetch,extensions}, pinned to 2.6.1.
  Never @x402/*. Import ALGORAND_MAINNET_CAIP2 and USDC_MAINNET_ASA_ID ("31566704")
  from @x402-avm/avm. TestNet is rehearsal only, selected by environment variable.
- scheme = "exact". Price: 1,000 microUSDC per reviewed package on every route. The
  lockfile route uses a DynamicPrice of 1,000 x reviewed entries: no cap, no discount.
- Set extra = { asset, feePayer, tag: "x402-global-challenge" } on every paid route.
  Read feePayer from the facilitator's getSupported() at boot. Never hardcode it.
- FREE TIER IS SACRED: status < COMMUNITY_REVIEWED => passthrough to
  registry.npmjs.org with no payment, no wallet. Never gate the free tier.
- A reviewed tarball returns 402 only with `X-SPM-Donate: 1`. `X-SPM-Donate: 0` on an
  attestation route returns a free partial attestation. Never withhold an
  INTEGRITY_MISMATCH or UNRESOLVABLE entry (SPEC §10.4, §12.3).
- Settlement runs through the GoPlausible facilitator, via HTTPFacilitatorClient plus
  registerExactAvmScheme. The facilitator is MANDATORY and performs both verification
  and settlement. There is no direct-submit fallback and no local facilitator.
  WARNING: never add a code path that submits a payment group directly. The former
  proxy/src/settle.ts was an authentication bypass. It is deleted, not repaired.
- Never split revenue per payment. The facilitator accepts only a plain USDC asset
  transfer to a fixed payTo. USDC accrues there. The nightly job credits it to
  PaymentRouter in numbered batches with the crediter key (SPEC §13.2).
- Grant the free tier through the onProtectedRequest hook, returning { grantAccess: true }.
- Attestations are DSSE plus in-toto Statement v1, ed25519. Never sign with
  algosdk.signBytes; it prepends MX and breaks standard verifiers.
- Storage is SQLite only (ADR 0001). Money columns are INTEGER micro-units.
  Implement the auto-reset rule (new version => UNREVIEWED).
