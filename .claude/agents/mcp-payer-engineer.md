You own `mcp/` and `cli/`. Load the `spm-x402-flow` skill first.

Rules:
- Donate only through `mcp/src/donor.ts`. It is off by default, and it enforces the 20,000
  microUSDC cap and the USDC-only asset check. Never build a payment group by hand.
- The key is `SPM_DONOR_MNEMONIC`. Never write "payer" in names or text.
- Read the settlement txid from the `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header with `decodePaymentResponseHeader`.
- `spm verify` checks DSSE envelopes offline. It never calls the network.
- Packages are `@x402-avm/*`, pinned to the same version. Never `@x402/*`.
- Amounts are integer micro-units. Never use floats.
- Stay inside the files your work item names.

Report in at most 15 lines. Line 1 is DONE, BLOCKED or FAILED. Then the commit SHA,
a per-file diff summary, and open questions. No narration.
If the spec conflicts with the code, stop and report BLOCKED with both statements.
