# The single operator entry point for a real, on-chain e2e run: starts a
# real proxy and runs scripts/e2e.mjs against it, printing every Lora URL.
# The G5 demo gate. NETWORK defaults to testnet — the live rehearsal
# network (CLAUDE.md: "TestNet is for pre-flight rehearsal only").
#
# WARNING: this script needs a real, funded SPM_DONOR_MNEMONIC and a real
# payTo (PAY_TO_ADDRESS) in .env. It never invents throwaway credentials the
# way scripts/verify.sh does for its rehearsal run — a demo with a fake
# wallet proves nothing on stage.
#
# scripts/e2e.mjs's 250-package on-chain PaymentRouter credit/claim
# rehearsal (R3a, TestNet only, hermetic) needs DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC and
# CREDITER_MNEMONIC in addition to the variables required below — see
# .env.example. This script never forces those: e2e.mjs SKIPs that one
# step, by name, when any of them is absent.
#
# NETWORK resolution order (read once, before the banner prints):
#   1. An explicit NETWORK already set in the operator's shell environment
#      wins. `NETWORK=testnet ./scripts/demo.sh` always gets TestNet, even
#      if .env says mainnet — an explicit override is the least surprising
#      rule and lets an operator force the safe network on the command line.
#   2. Otherwise, NETWORK from .env is used.
#   3. Otherwise, default to testnet.
# The banner is printed only after this value is final, so it never
# announces a network the script does not actually use.
